# Contacts App!
In this project, I designed a fully functional Contacts app.

Usage:

    1. Create a new contact by adding name, number and photo from local library
    2. Edit current contacts' name, number and photo
    3. Delete a contact
    4. Save and load all changes even if app is restarted
